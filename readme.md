# Simple Color bUFfers

Inspired by [muesli/termenv](https://github.com/muesli/termenv). This lib for the sake of simplicity dropped terminal support (different color profiles and etc.). Though these might be added without problem. For now works for linux and some terminals. Primarily made for personal usage with more convenient and simple API than `termenv`.

See usage examples in [cmd](./cmd/).
